EvalML is an open-source Python library for automatically building, optimizing, and evaluating machine learning pipelines for a given dataset. Like any other AutoML library, it also performs data pre-processing, feature engineering, selection, model building, hyper-parameter tuning, cross-validation, etc. automatically.
Here i have used  a dataset from kaggle which is based on classification (binary).
